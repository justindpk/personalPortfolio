						<h2> The Pursuit of Advancement </h2>

				        <strong>
				        All things technology have been my obsession from the moment I recieved my first computer, the <a href = "http://www.sumcomputers.com/photos/41/41816B.jpg"> Dell DHM </a>.
						After that day I found joy in things that should not be enojoyable to a ten year old child. Whenever I got the chance I spent hours with Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing and Putt-Putt. These programs, 
						and others alike, inspired me to gain a deeper understanding of the innner workings of software and computers as every aspect involved fascinated me.

						<strong>
						Fast forward 13 years and in the spring of 2020, I graduated from the University of Nevada-Reno with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Despite the aforementioned, 
						this is the first step of many. Frameworks and technologies, whose implementations are virtually limitless, are constantly being released and updated. Staying up to date is how we can continually push
						the envelope. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Throughout my career, I aim to initiate and particpate in the creation of remarkable applications, websites, and solutions that not only inspires 
						others and leads the way in widespread development, but also improves the user's quality of life. In my search for employment I hope to find a company that shares these goals and will facilitate my journey in acheving thus. 
						<br>
						<br>
						If you share these goals and are in need of a web developer, software developer, or product designer, please reach out on <a href="https:://github.com/justindpk">LinkedIn</a> or email me at jdapatrick@gmail.com
